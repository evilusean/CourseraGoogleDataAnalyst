## Ask
What is our business task? Our director of marketing at Cyclistic beleives that our future success,
as well as profits depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. We would wish to gain greater
insight as to how we can convert casual members into annual members. After coming to our data driven 
conclusions we should forward our plan to shareholders and executives for approval.


## Prepare
The Data we are using for this study is an aggregated dataset from April2021-April2022 of all users on 
5,824 bicycles linked to 692 docking stations. All pertinent identifiable information has been removed to
protect the privacy and safety of our customers. Data was downloaded in 12 zip files as CSV. 
Data was cleaned and converted to .xlsx using GoogleSheets.
Raw CSV's can be found here:

## Process
Data was organized under 15 columns(ride ID #, ride type, start/end time, ride length, day of the week
starting point(location,latitude/longitude), ending point(location, latitude/longitude), and member/casual rider.
Duplicate rows were removed, as well as NA or incomplete rows before final analysis. 
New columns for ride length and day of week were added.
